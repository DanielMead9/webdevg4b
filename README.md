We are Codalyze.  We came up with this name since it combines coding and analyzing of projects and code.

We are a code review company that will add commits and give support to your programs. This will be very helpful to many coders since we all know that we could use a second set of eyes on our program.

We thought this was a unique idea since every programmer knows when they hit a roadblock after working on projects for hours and don't know what to do. We are here to help you get back on track.
